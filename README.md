# miscelaneousprojects
This is an aggregate of projects I take upon for learning (courses, dataset exploration, etc.)
For now, you will find some of my homework from the Statistics With R Duke course, which consist mostly in applying 
statistical concepts to real datasets using R. 

I hope you enjoy it!
